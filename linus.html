            <h2>Background Story</h2>
            <p>Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software developer. He is best known for developing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank">Linux</a> kernel. Linus Torvalds was born 28 December, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland.
                Linus Torvalds creation of Linux transformed computing and software development through its <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source" target="_blank">open-source</a>, collaborative nature and becoming one of the largest free software projects. 
                Linus Torvalds has received numerous awards for his contributions to computing. He is also the inventor of the <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git Version Control System</a>. Git allows developers to track code changes and collaborate with other developers on the same project. Websites like <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> use Git and allow developers to collaborate.
                Both Linux and Git were programmed using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C programming language</a>. Like Linus Torvalds once said,<i> nothing is better done in C</i>.

                <h3>Linux Kernel</h3>
                <p>The Linux kernel is a free and open-source operating system. It was developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
                     Ever since the Linux kernel was released, many new operating systems have come to light (Linux Distro).
                      Linux can be found on a variety of devices. The Linux kernel can be found in Android, servers, personal computers, and supercomputers.
                       One thing you might not know is that Linus Torvalds was only 21 years old when he created the Linux kernel and did all this while living in his mother's apartment. Mind-boggling, I know. Other operating systems built using the Linux kernel are Ubuntu, Mint, Debian, Kali, and Red Hat.
                     All these Linux-based operating systems serve different purposes and vary when it comes to performance.</p>

                <h3>Linux</h3>
                <p>Linux is a Unix-like operating system based on the Linux kernel. It was first released on September 17, 1991, and the developer behind this operating system was the man himself, Linus Torvalds. 
                    Linux was built using C, Assembly, and other programming languages supported by the GCC compiler. Linux is one of the biggest open-source projects.
                     Linux runs on devices with an OS built into the firmware.
                      Examples are routers, consoles, smart TVs, automobiles, and spacecraft. Many <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong> developers prefer Linux for its performance over Windows.</p>

                <h3>Git</h3>
                <p>Git is a version control system that tracks changes to a number of computer files. Git is usually used by developers who are working on a big project or collaborating.
                     Linus Torvalds was the creator of Git in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel, but since then, a developer by the name of Junio Hamano has been the maintainer of Git.
                      Linus Torvalds initially created Git to be able to continue the development of the Linux kernel. The Git version control system was built using C, Shell scripts, and Perl.
                       Git revolutionised the open-source world and the way developers collaborate.</p>
