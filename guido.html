            <h2>Background Story</h2>
            <p>Guido van Rossum was born on January 31, 1956, in The Hague, Netherlands. He is best known as the creator of the <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> programming language.
                 His father was an architect, and his mother was a school teacher. He was the eldest of three children. In 1982, he received a master's degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Amsterdam.
                  His brother <a href="https://www.kabk.nl/en/teachers/just-van-rossum" target="_blank">Just van Rossum </a>is a type designer and programmer who designed the font for the <a href="https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-powered-w-200x80.png" target="_blank">"Python Powered"</a> logo.
                  After graduation in 1982, Van Rossum started working at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrum_Wiskunde_%26_Informatica" target="_blank">Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica</a>, where he helped develop the <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/abc/" target="_blank">ABC</a> programming language and also created a web browser called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grail_(web_browser)" target="_blank">Grail</a> that was also written in the Python programming language.</p>
            
            <h2>Contributions to Computing</h2>
    
            <div class="contributions">
                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>Python is a high-level programming language, meaning it can be understood by humans. 
                    Guido van Rossum initially created the Python programming language to be a successor to the ABC programming language.
                     Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, and he first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.
                     Python is the Swiss Army knife for developers since it is easy to learn and fast. The Python programming language was written in the C programming language. 
                     The release of Python opened many new doors, not just in computer science but in entertainment, transportation, medication, and web development (<a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/" target="_blank">Flask</a> and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a> are some nice web frameworks).</p>

                
                <h3>Cython</h3>
                <p>Cython is a superset of the Python programming language. It allows developers to write C( programming language) extensions for Python.
                     The minds behind Cython were Robert Bradshaw and Stefan Behnel. Cython was first released to the public on July 28, 2007.</p>

                <h3>PyPi</h3>
                <p>Pypi allows developers to install packages developed in the Python programming language. These packages save developers a lot of development time. Without Pypi, developers would have to code each function manually. 
                    For example, if you want to access your webcam using Python, there is a package called <a href="https://opencv.org/" target="_blank">OpenCV</a> that will allow you to do this, but without that package, you would have to create a function that does that action. Packages reduce a thousand lines of code to at least a hundred lines of code.Pypi allows developers to install packages developed in the Python programming language.
                     These packages save developers a lot of development time. Without Pypi, developers would have to code each function manually. PyPi was luanched in 2003.
                      

                <h3>PyGame</h3>
                <p>Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for developing video games. Pygame is an open-source project, meaning anyone can contribute to the development of the Python module. Pygame was released on October 28, 2000. Pygame was written in Python, C, Cython, and Cython.
                     Pygame is ideal for developers who want to make games without a game engine.
                      Pygame is maintained and developed by the PyGame Community.</p>
