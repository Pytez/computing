            <h2>Background Story</h2>
            <p>TimBL, better known as Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee, is an English computer scientist who is best known for creating the World Wide Web <strong>(WWW)</strong>, HTML <strong>(Hyper Text Markup Language)</strong>, the URL <strong>(Uniform Resource Locator)</strong> system, and HTTP <strong>(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</strong>. These four contributions played a big role in how the Internet worked. Tim Berners-Lee was born on June 8, 1955, in London, England.</p>
            <p>His parents <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Lee_Woods" target="_blank">Mary Lee Woods</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Conway Berners-Lee</a> were both computer scientists who worked on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferranti_Mark_1" target="_blank">Ferranti Mark 1</a>, so it wasn't much of a surprise that Tim Berners-Lee would grow up to be a computer scientist. Sir Tim Berners-Lee is the eldest of four children. Sir Tim Berners-Lee also has a brother who researches climate change, Mike Berners-Lee.
                  Not much is said about Sir Tim Berners-Lee's other siblings. After finishing a bachelor's degree in physics at Oxford University, he worked for a telecommunications company.
                   Then, in 1980, Sir Tim Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor for <a href="https://home.cern/" target="_blank">CERN</a>. While working at CERN, Sir Tim Berners-Lee had a vision of three big inventions that would revolutionise the Internet.</p>
            
            <h2>Contributions to Computing</h2>
    
            <div class="contributions">

                <h3>World Wide Web</h3>
                <p>WWW or World Wide Web was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN. The World Wide Web is an information system that allows information sharing over the internet. It also allows documents and other web resources to be accessed ovoer the internet easily. Sir Tim Berners-Lee's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:First_Web_Server.jpg" target="_blank">NeXT Computer</a> became the worlds first web server and hosted the first <a href="https://info.cern.ch/" target="_blank">website</a></p>
                
                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. Modern-day websites are often built using HTML, CSS, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>. Websites receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the first ever version of HTML in 1993, and it only had 18 HTML tags. The development of HTML 1.0 started in 1991 and was released to the public in 1993. Check out this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" target="_blank">extensible markup language</a>, XML.</p>
    
                <h3>URL</h3>
                <p>A URL, which stands for Uniform Resource Locator, was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1992. URL was one of the three inventions Sir Tim Berners-Lee created—what we call the Internet. The main use of a URL is to bring 'hypertext' to life. If the URL was never invented, we would be using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">FTP</a>.</p>
    
                <h3>HTTP</h3>
                <p>HTTP, which stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the base of the World Wide Web and is used to load webpages using hypertext links. The development of HTTP first began in 1989. Sir Tim Berners-Lee was the lead of this project while working at CERN. A classic flow over HTTP involves a client machine making a request to a server; the server then sends a response message. The purpose of HTTP was to transport information between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a web server. Learn more about HTTP <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>Although Tim Berners-Lee didn't invent CSS, he played a big role in its development. <a href="https://www.wiumlie.no/en" target="blank">Håkon Wium Lie</a>, Tim Berners-Lee's co-worker, is the inventor of CSS. Håkon Wium Lie was working alongside Tim Berners-Lee and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau" target="_blank">Robert Cailliau</a> at CERN in 1994. Håkon Wium Lie claimed he invented CSS <i>"to save HTML"</i> and it "solved a big problem". CSS also makes it easier to structure, style, and layout web pages. Without CSS, most webpages would most likely look like <a href="https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html" target="_blank">this</a>. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</p>
